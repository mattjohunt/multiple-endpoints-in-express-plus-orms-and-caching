Creating a Basic Server with Express
====================================

The purpose of this first workshop is to build a basic server using the Express library.

To do it, you'll need:

* Node 13.12.0 (or a higher version, install if from Self Service)
* Atom or another text editor (install it from Self Service).

Please don't use a JavaScript-specific IDE like WebStorm for this particular exercise. The object is to understand the basics of a JavaScript Express project.

Basic Steps
-----------

1. Create a directory, should be within this repo so that you can push your answer up to Github.
2. Initialise a Node.js project using npm. Ensure the entry point is a file called 'app.js'
3. Install express using npm
4. Use a text editor to create a file in the directory called "app.js"
5. Use online tutorials to write the correct code to serve an api endpoint.
6. Run your app using 'node app.js' and use your browser to view the result.

Before creating a full API endpoint, you might like to try having Express just send a "Hello World" message.

Once You're Done
----------------

If you found that horrifically easy, then use Self Service to install Postgres, and see if you can pull information from a database table into you Express API, then display it.
