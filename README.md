## Further Expertise Programme Javascript Course

These are the support files for the post-covid FEP programme for JavaScript. They are also for use with additional JavaScript courses run in BPDTS.

In common with other post-covid training courses in Engineering, these sessions are now 'flipped' and broken up.

For each session, we'll direct you to the support materials and ask you to read the supporting documentation and complete a task. We'll have a short meeting a week later to discuss challenges encountered and consolidate what we've learned.

If at any point during the week after receiving the materials and during the project you have any problems, please contact the coordinator for the course. If no coordinator has been assigned, please approach your DSPM or Deputy Head of Engineering.

Notes for each course in the FEP Javascript programme are contained within numbered directories.
